# twox_onedrive
This extension let's you increase the playback speed of video players on sites like onedrive. 

This extension is a basically a scaffolding for a basic code snippet used to change the playback speed.

*This can be used on a lot of other sites as well, but I have not tested other sites, since I only needed to watch some lectures on one drive at 2x speed.*
